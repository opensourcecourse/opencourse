# Course Structure

All of the course content can be found at the [OpenSourceCourse github organization](https://github.com/opensourcecourse).

The content of the course is organized by modules. Each module contains three components:

### Overview

The overview strives to give a short, motivating introduction to the topic and learning objectives.
Before each module is presented in class, you should review the overview, including the links in the reading sections
(but feel free to skip additional resources). This doesn't mean you need to understand everything in the reading,
but do come to class with well-formed questions.

### Slides

The slides contain the material that will be presented in class. You can look them over but this is not required.

### Exercises

The exercises are to be done after class. They are essential to help you internalize the concepts
and develop the skills you need to be successful. Although they are not difficult or overly time-consuming, please do
treat them seriously.

# Enlisting

You should start by creating a github account, if you don't already have one. Then, you sign up for the course by
joining the [student team](https://github.com/orgs/opensourcecourse/teams/students) of the OSC organization. Next,
follow the [setup guid](setup.qmd).

# Getting Help

Office hours for the instructors will be posted. You are also encouraged to use the
[metacourse repo](https://github.com/opensourcecourse/metacourse) for asking questions, engaging in discussions,
or raising issues.

# Collaboration

If you notice any ways to improve the content of OSC please do it! Each page on the website has an
"edit in GitHub" button, or a github icon, which you can click on to make quick pull requests in your browser.
