# Course Structure

All of the course content can be found at the [OpenSourceCourse github organization](https://github.com/opensourcecourse).

The content of the course is organized by modules. Each module contains three components:

### Overview

The overview strives to give a very short, motivating introduction to the topic and learning objectives.
Before each module is presented in class, you should review the overview (but feel free to skip additional resources).
This doesn't mean you need to understand every reading or spend lots of time delving deep into each resource,
but do look over them and come to class prepared to ask questions.

### Slides

The slides contain the material that will be presented in class. You can look them over but this is not required.

### Exercises

The exercises are to be done at the end of or after class. They are essential for helping you internalize the concepts
and develop the skills you need to be successful. Although they are not difficult or overly time-consuming, please do
treat them seriously.

# Enlisting

You should start be creating a github account, if you don't already have one. Then, you sign up for the course by
joining the [student team](https://github.com/orgs/opensourcecourse/teams/students) of the OSC organization.

# Getting Help

Office hours for the instructors will be posted. You are also encouraged to use the
[metacourse repo](https://github.com/opensourcecourse/metacourse) for asking questions, engaging in discussions, or raising
issues.
