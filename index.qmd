# Course Structure

All of the course content can be found at the [OpenSourceCourse github organization](https://github.com/opensourcecourse).

The content of the course is organized by modules. Each module contains three components:

### Overview

The overview strives to give a short introduction to the topic and module overview.
Before each module is presented in class, you should review the overview, including the links in the reading sections
(but feel free to skip additional resources). This doesn't mean you need to understand everything in the reading,
but do come to class with well-formed questions.

### Slides

The slides contain the material that will be presented in class. You can look them over but this is not required.

### Exercises

The exercises are to be done after class. They are essential to help you internalize the concepts
and develop the skills you need to be successful. Although they are not difficult or time-consuming, please do
treat them seriously.

# Enlisting

You should start by creating a github account, if you don't already have one. Then, you sign up for the course by
joining the [student team](https://github.com/orgs/opensourcecourse/teams/students) of the OSC organization. Next,

# Getting Help
