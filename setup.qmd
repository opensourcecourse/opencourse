In order to avoid wasting class time setting up software, please go through the following before class:

# Create a Github Account

This is straight-forward. Got to [Github's website](https://github.com/) and click sign up on the top right. Of course,
if you already have a github account you can skip this step.


# Setup Git

Here we will make sure your git installation is working and configured properly to push to github. If you know git is
already installed on your machine and you have recently pushed content to a github repo you can skip this section.

1. Make sure you have [git installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on your laptop.
2. [Create a personal repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) called "git_test"
3. Clone your repo

with https
```bash
git clone https://github.com/{your_user_name}/git_test
```

or with ssh
```bash
git clone git@github.com:{your_user_name}/git_test
```

4. Make a small change
Simply add a file called README.txt and write some text in there such as "this is a test"

5. Stage the change
```bash
git add -A
```

6. Commit the change
```bash
git commit -m "test message"
```

7. Push to origin
```bash
git push origin main
```
or if master is the name of the default branch

```bash
git push origin master
```

If this works you are good to go. If not, see the following note.

:::{.callout-note}

If you haven't done so yet, you may need to either:
1) Setup a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
to use https or 2) Setup [ssh keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) to use ssh.

# Setup Python

There are several ways to setup python but we recommend using [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). You
may also want to [create a virtual environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands)
for the course.
