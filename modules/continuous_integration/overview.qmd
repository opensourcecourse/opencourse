The most powerful tool we have as developers is automation.

# Continuous Integration

At its heart, continuous integration (or related terms) really means automation. Automation of what exactly
depends on the software. For a website, such as this one, it means building and deploying site every time a change is
merged into the main branch. For numerical scientific library it could mean linting the code, running the test suite,
publishing benchmarks, building and deploying the documentation, releasing a new version to PyPI, etc. Practically
anything that can be automated can be included in CI.

In the dark times before 2018, projects on github wishing to test their code on different operating systems were forced
to employ a hodgepodge different CI services, each with its own API and quirks. These days, practically everything
can be done with Github actions. For Free.

# Objectives

In this module we will:

1. Highlight different applications of Github Actions
2. Look at Github's YAML syntax for writing actions
3. Discus some useful community actions and how to use them
4. Overview CI debugging and maintenance practices
