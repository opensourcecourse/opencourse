All issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred and schizophrenia.

# Issues

All software has issues. Sometimes this is because the intended behavior of the program was not communicated, or
understood, or sometimes because there is a genuine bug. Either way, when you encounter such problems in open-source
software, you should report the issue. Github provides a mechanism, suitably called "issues", which is just what it
sounds like: a report about a problem, or more precisely, a deviation from expected behavior, experienced by a user.
In an open-source context, most issues are a petition to a volunteer to spend his or her time helping you solve your
problem or answer your question. In light of this, it behooves you to make that proposition as compelling as possible.

In this module we will cover open-source etiquette for reporting issues, and the main components of a good issue.

# Objectives
