Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.

The most widely used medium for contributing to open-source software are issues and pull requests. An issue is just what
it sounds like, a report about a problem, or more precisely, a deviation from expected behavior, experienced by a user.
In an open-source context, most issues are a petition to a volunteer to spend his or her time helping you solve your
problem or answer your question. In light of this, you should make that proposition as compelling as possible.

A Pull Request is a proposed change to the main branch of the software. It might contain a fix or a new feature. Whether
the PR gets merged, or is actually a net positive to the project, depends on several (very human) factors, but ensuring
your PRs are well prepared and showing you put forth effort to following project guidelines goes a long ways!

Lastly, when you are in a position to review other's work it is important to treat everyone with respect while also
maintaining project standard and vision. Conducting effective code reviews that leave all parties encouraged to improve
is a difficult art to master!
