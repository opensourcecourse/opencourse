You can do a lot of things with git, and many of the rules of what you *should* do are not so much
technical limitations but are about what works well when working together with other people.
So git is a very powerful set of tools.

# Git

Git is a class of software known as a version control system (VCS). It is used to help developers manage the
complexity of collaborative development, as well as to create and store robust backups of software.

While very few devs are actually git experts, knowing the basics is *absolutely essential* for collaborative development.
While other VCS exist, git is used almost exclusively these days.

# Objectives

In this module, we will:

1. Present a graphical model of git
2. Review some important git operations (with pictures)
3. Look at a common procedure for making a contribution
