# Software Testing

Testing is probably the most important topic in software engineering. This is because malfunctioning software can have dire
consequences, like [causing a multi-million dollar satellite to crash into mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter),
[flashing the infamous blue screen of death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbER5TVTHEc&t=29s) during a live demo,
or bankrupting an entire firm in a few minutes by
[losing $440 million dollars in bad trades](https://www.henricodolfing.com/2019/06/project-failure-case-study-knight-capital.html).
There have also been high profile bugs in scientific software, like when protein structure analysis code
[swapped two data columns](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.314.5807.1856) producing spurious results
that lead to a retraction of five research papers, hundreds of hours of wasted research time, and a ruined career.
Testing is our main defense against such spectacular failures, and the way we gain confidence that a code works.

Testing strategies are varied, from manually testing a code as it is written, to creating a massive suite of
automated tests that run every line (or branch) of the code under test, sometimes dynamically changing test inputs.
The appropriate testing strategy depends on the nature of code. Understanding a code can result in the type of costly
mistakes mentioned above, but over testing can also cause lead to software failure by exploding budgets and failing to
meet deadlines. Selecting the right testing strategy is an art that takes time to master.

Testing could easily be a whole course (or several courses). Here we simply try to highlight some of the main ideas
and provide good resources for further reading.

# Objectives

In this module, we will:

1. Discuss prevalent testing taxonomies and their components
2. Discuss different testing philosophies
3. Provide guidance on selecting the appropriate testing strategy for different types of software
4. Demonstrate a few simple examples of testing in python.
