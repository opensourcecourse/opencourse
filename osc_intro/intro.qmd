This course covers Git, style guides, advanced python features, testing, documentation, and collaborative coding using GitHub.

It is designed to help engineering/science students learn to effectively contribute to the
open-source scientific python ecosystem.

You can find a video introduction [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4ru68A31Uk)

# Course Learning Outcomes
After successfully completing the course you will be able to:

1. Use the Git version control system to manage software projects.
2. Apply style guides to codebases.
3. Design object-oriented and functional python implementations for solving computing problems.
4. Use the pytest framework to verify correctness of programs.
5. Design documentation which effectively advertises and explains a project.
6. Evaluate pull request and bug report quality and provide feedback for making improvements.
7. Create and submit code contributions which follow best practices and project guidelines.

# Prerequisites

This course is designed for students with some Python experience. Specifically you should:

1. Be well-versed with writing python functions
2. Be familiar with common data structures like lists, dicts, tuples, etc.
3. Understand iteration and indexing
4. Understand Python's control flow (if/then, for, while, etc.)
5. Know how to install python packages and manage python environments
6. Be semi-comfortable using a terminal (command line)

Although the content is meant to be approachable, this is not a beginning python/computing course.

If you don't feel comfortable with these topics, the [Python Intro course material](../python_intro/intro.qmd) may be a better place to start.

See the [OSC overview page](../index.qmd) for general information on course structure. 


## Project

The last part of this course is to make a non-trivial contribution to an open-source project. You can
add a feature to an existing library, or release a small package of your own. More details are found
in the [collaborative development exercise](https://github.com/opensourcecourse/collaborative-development-assignment). 

## Setup

Follow the [setup guide](setup.qmd) to get setup for this course.
