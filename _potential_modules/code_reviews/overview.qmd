# Code Review

Code reviews play an important role in maintaining high quality community software. They are also an excellent
opportunity for semi-formal mentoring and learning. However, if done poorly, they can fail to improve code
in any significant way and leave a bad impression with the involved parties. Like many other tasks that
can be thought of as purely technical, there are some significant human factors at play that need to be respected.

In this model we discuss how to effectively conduct and respond to code reviews using Github.

# Objectives

In this module we will:

1. Highlight best practices for code reviews
2. Demonstrate Github's code review mechanisms
