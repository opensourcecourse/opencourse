This module covers some common built-in datatypes in python.

Understanding these datatypes is not only important for using python effectively, but also for understanding more advanced concepts of python's type system.

# Objectives

After completing this module you will be able to:

1. Create python variables

2. Identify usages of basic python types, including:
   * Numeric types: int, float, complex
   * Boolean
   * Strings 
   * Container types: list and dict

3. Debug short code snippets using these concepts
