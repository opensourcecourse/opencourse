This module covers some common built-in datatypes in python.

Understanding these datatypes is not only important for using python effectively, but also for understanding more advanced features of python's type system and implementation.

# Objectives

In this module we will learn about:

1. Numeric types: int, float, complex
2. Boolean
3. Strings
4. Containers: list and dict
